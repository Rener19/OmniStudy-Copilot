# OmniStudy Copilot 🎓

OmniStudy Copilot is a mobile-first, AI-powered learning engine that transforms uploaded educational PDFs into an interactive learning experience. This project is a 4th-year computer science internship capstone, built over an 8-week sprint with a strong focus on high engineering rigor, streaming UI, state management, complex gesture handling, and robust AI data pipelines.

## 🚀 Features

- **RAG Chat Engine**: A conversational interface to query your documents. Features real-time streaming responses and exact page-number citations to trace AI answers back to the source text.
- **Spaced-Repetition Flashcards**: AI-generated flashcards (strict JSON parsing) presented in a swipeable, Tinder-style deck. It utilizes a spaced-repetition algorithm (like SM-2) to schedule reviews based on your swipe direction (Remembered vs. Forgotten).
- **Dynamic Quiz Engine**: AI-generated assessments including Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-Blanks. Features dynamic UI component mounting, real-time grading, and knowledge gap summaries.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Built entirely on $0-deployment-cost free-tier services.

### Frontend (Mobile & Web)
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Libraries**: `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `axios`, Expo Router
- **Design**: Mobile-first cross-platform UI

### Backend (API & AI Pipeline)
- **Framework**: Python with FastAPI (Deployed on Render)
- **Data Parsing**: `PyPDF2` / `pdfplumber`
- **Validation**: Strict schema validation with Pydantic
- **AI Orchestration**: Google Gen AI SDK (Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash)

### Database & Auth
- **Platform**: Supabase (Free Tier)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with `pgvector` for embedding storage and similarity search
- **Services**: Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage (for PDFs)

## 🏗 Architecture & Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**: PDF Upload -> FastAPI Extraction -> Text Chunking (with page tracking) -> Gemini Embeddings -> Supabase `pgvector`.
2. **Chat**: User Query -> Vector Similarity Search -> Gemini Context Injection -> Streamed Response (SSE).
3. **Flashcards & Quizzes**: Prompt Gemini -> Pydantic Schema Validation -> Supabase Storage -> React Native Dynamic Rendering.

## 💻 Local Setup (Coming Soon)

Instructions for setting up the local development environment for both the FastAPI backend and Expo frontend will be added as the project progresses.
